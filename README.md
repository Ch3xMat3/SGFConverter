# SGFConverter
Python program to convert sgf files into a text file containing the comma separated moves in alpha numerical format


Contains a gui window allowing you to select your sgf file to convert and save the file as a text document.

You do not have to add an extension to the filename as the program will automatically make it a .txt file.

Can be converted to a windows executable with the use of the 'pyinstaller' python command with the syntax 'pyinstaller sgfconvert.py'
